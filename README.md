#  Character-Level Text Generation with LSTM (Dinosaur names)

This project implements a **character-level language model** using an **LSTM neural network** to generate new dinosaur names.  
The model learns patterns from a dataset of real dinosaur names and then generates new, realistic-sounding names character by character.

##  Project Overview

- Task: Character-level language modeling  
- Model: Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM)  
- Framework: Python + NumPy (from scratch, no high-level DL libraries)  
- Application: Text generation (name synthesis)  
- Dataset: List of dinosaur names  

The model is trained to predict the next character in a sequence given previous characters, allowing it to generate new names such as:
- Loposaurus
- Megalotron
- Triceradon
- Velociraptorix
